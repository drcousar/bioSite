            <p>
            Taylor is from Pearl Mississippi and attends Pearl Junior High School.  Early in life, Taylor developed multiple ear infections, which led to speech issues.  Through years of therapy Taylor went from a speech impairment to no impairment at all.  As a matter of fact, Taylor is now a public speaker and speaks very well. 
            
            Taylor has leveraged her power of public speaking into positions of leadership where she speaks in front of large audiences.  Taylor was the Vice President of the student council and also has served as President of the Beta Club.
            
            <p>
            	Taylor is also a star athlete.  She is a Striker on the soccer team.  Taylor is a crowd pleaser and scores many goals.  Taylor is also on the volleyball team.  She plays so well, she often gets elected to play with the older kids.  Her teammates call her "Tipping Tay", because of her knack for tipping the ball over the net, saving the ball from hitting the floor on their side of the net. 
            </p>
            	
            <p> 
            Taylor's goal is to become a lawyer.  I am just proud that she is a well rounded kid.  I don't know if her awesome grades or sports abilities will get her a scholarship, but even without one, she's the best in my book.
